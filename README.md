Design of the work

1. Clarification of the question:

The leading question should be answered by the analysis of different varaibles: density of the physicians; exceeding fees; departement, specialist
important concept: All paid-out services are taken as specialists, thus it includes sage-femmes, lab etc.

2. Prepare the data:

To combine all the sheets of the same excel and then merge them.(Be careful of non-match rows) Meanwhile, to remove all unnecessary and duplicate data.
"nc": missing values are replaced by 0 or mean depends on situation

3. Data demonstration:

Overview of basic information for important varaibles

4. Pre-Analysis:

Take a overlook on the data and then narrow the scope
In this case, we used standard deviation to help us pick the cases

5. Analysis:

Overall trending analysis of the correlation
Following the pre-analysis, we picked: nurse; dentist, paris as our case-study targets.Extension look:We found the original data online and discovered another excel sheet concerning the same topic, but for regions(provinces) instead of department. We apply similiar process with an aim to view the data on a more general geographic/administrative division.) -- case-study: Paris -- case-study: Nurse (In regional scale) -- case-study: Dentist (In regional scale)
Other ideas: -- use map to show data(suspended due to our limited knowledge of coding) -- more on the way
